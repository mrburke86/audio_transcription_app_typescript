Organize your guidance using clear sections:

**IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:** [What to say/do right now]
**STRATEGIC CONTEXT:** [Why this approach works]
**KEY TALKING POINTS:** [Main points to cover]
**POTENTIAL RESPONSES:** [How they might react]
**NEXT STEPS:** [How to advance the conversation]
**WATCH FOR:** [Important signals or warning signs]`,

            EXAMPLE: `**IMMEDIATE RESPONSE:** Acknowledge their concern and ask a clarifying question
**STRATEGIC CONTEXT:** This shows you're listening and helps you understand the root issue
**KEY TALKING POINTS:** 
- Validate their perspective
- Ask about underlying needs
- Share relevant experience if applicable
**POTENTIAL RESPONSES:** They may elaborate on concerns or ask about your experience
**NEXT STEPS:** Based on their response, either address concerns or pivot to solution discussion
**WATCH FOR:** Emotional signals, buying signals, or resistance indicators`,
        },

        CONVERSATIONAL: {
            FORMAT: `**CONVERSATIONAL RESPONSE FORMAT:**

Provide guidance in a natural, flowing style that integrates:
- Immediate tactical advice seamlessly woven into strategic context
- Specific word choices and phrasing suggestions
- Emotional and relational considerations
- Multiple options based on how the conversation develops

Focus on readability and practical application rather than rigid structure.`,

            EXAMPLE: `I'd recommend acknowledging their concern directly - something like "I can understand why that would be important to you" - which validates their perspective while opening the door for deeper discussion. 

From there, you could ask a strategic question like "What would need to be true for you to feel confident moving forward?" This shifts the conversation from problems to solutions while showing you're genuinely interested in their success.

Watch their body language and tone when you ask this - if they lean in and engage, you're building trust. If they seem hesitant, you might need to address underlying concerns first before moving to solution mode.`,

            FORMAT: `**BULLET POINT RESPONSE FORMAT:**

• **Strategic Question:** [Question to advance conversation]
• **Watch For:** [Important signals]
• **If/Then Scenarios:** [Conditional responses]

            EXAMPLE: `• **Immediate Action:** Pause, acknowledge their concern, ask clarifying question

• **Strategic Question:** "What would need to change for this to work better?"
• **Watch For:** Level of engagement, emotional tone, specific objections mentioned

            EXAMPLE: `**WHAT TO SAY:** "I appreciate you sharing that concern with me. Before I respond, can you help me understand what specifically worries you most about [specific issue]?"

**WHY THIS WORKS:** The appreciation acknowledgment validates them, the pause shows respect, and the specific question gets to root concerns rather than surface objections.

**ALTERNATIVES:** 
- If they seem emotional: "I can see this is really important to you..."
