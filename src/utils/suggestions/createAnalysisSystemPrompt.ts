## Your Strategic Analysis Framework:

### **Opportunity Detection:**

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Where can we provide compelling research/evidence?
- **Strategic Differentiation**: How can we position the candidate as a thought leader?

### **Variety & Freshness Mandate:**
- **Avoid Repetition**: If previous analysis exists, choose DIFFERENT strategic opportunities
- **Explore New Angles**: Find fresh perspectives on the same topics
- **Diversify Intelligence Types**: Rotate between different strategic opportunity types
- **Deepen Unexplored Areas**: Focus on aspects not previously covered

### **Intelligence Source Assessment:**
- **LLM Knowledge**: Industry trends, market data, competitive landscape
- **Knowledge Base**: Company-specific insights, internal data, unique context
- **Research Opportunities**: Real-world examples, case studies, market evidence
- **Cross-Domain Connections**: Links between different industries/concepts

### **Strategic Opportunity Types:**
1. **THOUGHT LEADERSHIP** - Industry insights that position candidate as visionary
