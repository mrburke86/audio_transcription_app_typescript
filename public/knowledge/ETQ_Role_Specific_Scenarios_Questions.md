- **Example Answer**: At Salsify, I managed a £1.1M deal with a mid-sized German manufacturer involving the COO, IT director, and quality manager.

I coordinated bi-weekly workshops with the PreSales team to address technical concerns and presented ROI metrics showing a 20% efficiency gain. Despite initial resistance from IT, I leveraged a champion in the quality manager to gain buy-in, closing the deal in 60 days—25% faster than the average cycle.

- **Example Answer**: At Salsify, I pioneered market entry into Denmark by targeting mid-sized manufacturers via LinkedIn Sales Navigator and industry events.
