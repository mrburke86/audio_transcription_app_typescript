## 3. Core Real-time Components

### 3.1 Live Speech Recognition System

**Location**: `/src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts`

**Purpose**: Captures and transcribes interviewer questions in real-time.

**Live Interview Features**:

-   **Continuous listening** - never misses a question
-   **Auto-restart capability** - maintains connection if interrupted
-   **Real-time transcription** - shows what's being heard as it happens
-   **Audio visualization** - provides visual feedback of speech detection
-   **Error resilience** - handles network issues and permission problems gracefully

**Critical for Live Use**:

-   **Low latency** - minimal delay between speech and transcription
-   **High accuracy** - ensures questions are captured correctly
-   **Reliability** - automatically recovers from interruptions

### 3.2 Intelligent Response Generation Engine

**Location**: `/src/hooks/useLLMProviderOptimized.ts`

**Purpose**: Generates perfect responses that users can read verbatim during interviews.

**Response Generation Process**:

1. **Context Assembly** - Combines interviewer question with relevant personal knowledge **retrieved via semantic search from the vectorized knowledge base (Qdrant)**.
2. **Strategic Prompt Engineering** - Creates sophisticated prompts for optimal positioning
3. **Real-time Streaming** - Delivers responses progressively for immediate reading
4. **Conversation Continuity** - Maintains context across the entire interview

**Response Optimization Features**:

-   **Verbatim-ready language** - responses designed to be spoken naturally
-   **Strategic positioning** - incorporates user's achievements and differentiators
-   **Confidence indicators** - bold text highlights key points for emphasis
-   **Length optimization** - appropriate response length for interview context

### 3.3 Personal Knowledge Base System

**Location**:

-   **Access & Status Management**: `src/contexts/KnowledgeProvider.tsx`
-   **Vector DB Interaction**: `src/services/QdrantService.ts`
-   **Data Indexing**: API Route `src/app/api/knowledge/index-knowledge/route.ts`
-   **Data Storage**: Qdrant (Dockerized Vector Database)

**Purpose**: Manages access to and retrieval from a **vectorized personal knowledge base** using semantic search, providing comprehensive and highly relevant context about the user's background for AI response generation.

**Knowledge Categories**:

-   **Career achievements** - specific metrics, deals, and successes
-   **Sales methodologies** - frameworks like MEDDPICC the user knows
-   **Industry expertise** - manufacturing, quality management, regulatory knowledge
-   **Company knowledge** - previous employers and their contexts
-   **Success stories** - detailed examples for response incorporation

**Live Interview Intelligence**:

-   **Semantic retrieval**: Employs vector embeddings and similarity search (via Qdrant) to find the most contextually relevant background information based on the nuances of the interviewer's question and conversation flow.
-   **Achievement integration**: Weaves specific accomplishments, retrieved through semantic search, into AI-generated responses.
-   **Strategic positioning**: Leverages precisely retrieved knowledge to position the user optimally for the target role.

**Knowledge Base Indexing**:

-   **Decoupled Process**: Indexing is handled separately from the main application load and live interview operations.
-   **API Trigger**: An administrator can trigger the indexing process via a secure API endpoint (`/api/knowledge/index-knowledge`).
-   **Mechanism**:
    1. Source documents (e.g., Markdown files in `/public/knowledge/`) are read by the API route.
    2. Content is split into manageable chunks.
    3. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using an OpenAI embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).
    4. These embeddings, along with their source text and metadata, are stored (upserted) into the Qdrant vector database.
-   **Control**: Allows for manual updates or re-indexing of the knowledge base without impacting live application performance.

### 3.4 Interview Context Configuration

**Location**: `/src/app/chat/_components/InitialInterviewContextModal/`

**Purpose**: Pre-configures the session for optimal response generation during the live interview.

**Live Interview Setup**:

-   **Target role and company** - tailors responses to specific opportunity
-   **Interview type configuration** - adapts style for behavioral, technical, or executive interviews
-   **Experience emphasis** - prioritizes which achievements to highlight
-   **Response confidence level** - adjusts assertiveness (safe, balanced, bold)
-   **Strategic messaging** - defines key positioning points

**Pre-Interview Benefits**:

-   **Consistent messaging** - ensures aligned responses throughout interview
-   **Strategic positioning** - maintains focus on key differentiators
-   **Confidence optimization** - adapts response style to interview context

## 4. Live Interview Data Flow

### Real-time Processing Pipeline

`Interviewer Question → Speech Recognition → Context Analysis (Semantic KB Query) → AI Processing → Response Streaming → User Delivery`

### Detailed Live Flow

1. **Question Capture Phase**
    - Interviewer asks question
    - Web Speech Recognition API transcribes in real-time
    - Transcription appears in "Live Transcription" area
    - User can see question being captured
2. **Question Processing Phase**
    - User clicks "Move" to process the question
    - The system generates an embedding for the transcribed question (and potentially recent conversation context).
    - This embedding is used to **query the Qdrant vector database, performing a semantic search** for the most relevant chunks of information from the personal knowledge base.
    - Previous conversation context is considered for refining queries or augmenting retrieved knowledge.
    - Interview configuration (from `InitialInterviewContextModal`) is applied to tailor the approach.
3. **AI Response Generation Phase**
    - A comprehensive prompt is constructed including:
        - The interviewer's specific question.
        - **Relevant personal achievements and experience retrieved as precise chunks from Qdrant.**
        - Strategic positioning context.
        - Interview goals and messaging.
    - OpenAI generates an optimized response.
    - Response streams in real-time to the conversation area.
4. **Live Delivery Phase**
    - User reads the streamed response verbatim.
    - Bold text indicates key points for emphasis.
    - Response is structured for natural speech delivery.
    - Conversation continues with maintained context.
5. **Context Maintenance Phase**
    - Interview conversation is summarized.
    - Strategic intelligence suggestions are updated.
    - System prepares for the next question with full context, potentially using conversation summary to enhance future Qdrant queries.
